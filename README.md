this is a software about sending emails from a scrapping from large un organised text from any source 
it uses, utf - 8 encoding 

HOW TO USE IT 

- just double click the file or if it opens in your code editor then just open it in your python cli 
- and then you will get a TKINTER GUI 
- just paste the text on the box and it'll automatically extract all the emails 
- and you have to enter your gmail ID and password from which you want to send the mails from 
- and write a subject or text or you can also attach a PDF file it only supports PDFs
- and then just press send it will your mail to all those extracted emails at once 

i made it to apply to many companies at once from places like watsapp where multiple HRs provide there 
emails so with this s/w i was able to send hundreds or thousands of mails at once and it helped me alot and
it was a great project as well.
